This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
myURL <- "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/bridges/bridges.data.version1"
bridges <- read.table(file = myURL, header = FALSE, sep = ",", na.strings = "NA")
ID <- c(bridges[1])
River <- c(bridges[2])
Location <-c(bridges[3])
Purpose <-c(bridges[5])
Material <-c(bridges[10])
myBridge <- data.frame(ID, River, Location, Purpose, Material)

#remove "?" from Materials
levels (myBridge$V10) <- c(levels(myBridge$V10), c(NA))
myBridge$V10[myBridge$V10 == "?"] = NA

myBridge
```
