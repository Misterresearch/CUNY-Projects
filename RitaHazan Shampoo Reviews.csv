PRODUCT,SOURCE,REVIEW,RATING,DATETrue Color Shampoo,RitaHazan.com,It's a fantastic shampoo for colored hair.,5 Stars,2/16/17True Color Shampoo,RitaHazan.com,This is an amazing shampoo!! I recommend it to all my friends!,5 Stars,12/29/15True Color Shampoo,RitaHazan.com,this product is amazing,4 Stars,12/16/15True Color Shampoo,Amazon,Smells great but does nothing to help hold color. Got same results with cheap Tresseme brand. Don't waste your money.,1 Star,4/24/17True Color Shampoo,Amazon,This is an amazing product both the shampoo and the conditioner. It has saved me a lot of money on hair color. I can actially now have root toucb ups instead of payong for color all over. On my second bottle and will continie to order,5 Stars,6/29/17True Color Shampoo,Amazon,"This has a nice smell, seems to work well. I wish I could get the conditioner to go with it on Amazon, but over all I would purchase again. I have to wash my hair frequently because I workout almost everyday. So, my hair gets dry. This seems to help a bit.",4 Stars,8/21/16True Color Shampoo,Amazon,Love the way this shampoo/conditioner smells and makes my hair feel but I do t think it does much to preserve my color.,4 Stars,5/28/16True Color Shampoo,Amazon,Love it!,5 Stars,5/19/17True Color Shampoo,Amazon,"I am sorry to say, this shampoo strips my color all too soon. It dried my hair out and my color just did not hold up",1 Star,5/15/17True Color Shampoo,Amazon,"I really like this shampoo and the conditioner. I have very fine color treated hair and these products don't weight it down at all, no does it make it frizzy or flyaway. The only thing that I've noticed and that you should be aware of is that you can not use the shampoo alone or your hair will be a tangled, dried out frizzy mess, it works great with the paired conditioner though, this will be my third bottle, I think this is the best product I've ever used but like I said, don't expect good results if you use the shampoo alone, get the conditioner to go with it. Robert's Wife",4 Stars,3/29/17True Color Shampoo,Amazon,"I have really dry hair curly from years of coloring and have tried numerous sulfate shampoos. I found the RH shampoo combined with the RH conditioner has worked best for me - I also use a bit of Paul Mitchel leave in conditioner. This combination has left my hair in the best condition its been in years, soft, not weighed down, nice volume with blow dry - so I am sold. I also can get away with not shampooing everyday. I bought the shampoo and conditioner after reading an interview with Rita. I was intrigued with her expertise with color and sounded like she had the cred to develop hair care products for color treated hair. I sought out her website based on this interview (and from where I originally purchased) no products were provided to me for promotional purposes, I have no connection with the company and I purchased with my own funds.",4 Stars,10/17/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"This shampoo actually deserves but I'm going to base my review on its performance which was fantastic not its scent which was overpowering all day long over everything else. I have a lot of thick, curly, color treated hair that goes to about my bra straps. I could tell from the moment I combed my hair out that my curls looked awesome after using this shampoo even though it's not for curly haired girls. It just kept looking better and better as it dried, it's a rare day when I don't fiddle endlessly or put it up because I hate the way it looks or its too frizzy. Unfortunately, I can't continue to use this because the scent is so overpowering, especially if my head gets a little warm like outside or any activity, it becomes gag inducing and almost really masculine. It's a shame because I would certainly shell out the money to love my hair like this since I only wash it once or twice a week.",4 Stars,7/5/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"The smell was interesting, it's not for everyone. I liked how it lathered but it seemed to make my hair frizzy and wirey...it's usually a little wild if I don't straighten or curl it but it's always smooth. It seems rather rough today. I wish I could try it again tonight but the sample I got only had enough for one wash =(",2 Stars,3/16/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"First of all, it smells fantastic!! Secondly, it makes your hair feel clean. With all the hair color and products that I use, every time I use this I see all the build up wash away! I would definitely follow up with the conditioner as that's what adds the moisture back in your hair without making your hair greasy.",5 Stars,9/22/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I tried the free samples (2 of them), and followed the directions. While it did seem to do fine with keeping my hair color intact, the texture of my hair afterwards was like a whisk broom. It stuck out all over my head and was very wiry. I normally have fine, soft, naturally curly hair. I don't think I will be using this product or recommending it.",2 Stars,3/10/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I really love this shampoo because it is one of the first sulfate-free shampoos that actually suds up and deeply cleans my hair. Having color treated hair, I love that it is safe for my processed locks. The only not so great thing is that it's a bit drying.",4 Stars,2/16/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I appreciate the other reviews, but it seems many have reviewed the shampoo based on a sample. I too received a sample, tried it, and loved the shampoo. But after purchasing and using the shampoo for several days, my hair started to feel really dry. I didn't like the texture of my hair using the shampoo and conditioner together, so chose to combine the Rita Hazen shampoo with a different brand. It's disappointing because I loved the fullness and body the shampoo created the first one or two uses and wish it had kept up. It's possible this would be a great shampoo to use alternatively with another, but it's costly enough to make that not really an option for me. I'm really on the fence with this, but I think you really have to use it more than a trial size allows to get the real sense.",3 Stars,4/11/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I am a product junkie with color treated fine but, thick hair. This shampoo partnered with the conditioner restores my hair color and gives it that....just left the salon look. Heavily scented but, I love it. I don't understand some of the comments that it is drying. Maybe not using the conditioner?",5 Stars,4/17/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,Used a sample of this shampoo and conditioner and now I'm soooo in love. I am big on strong fragrance so I love the smell . Trying to justify the cost for the size. Somehow I know I will. Awesome...the crazy price is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.,4 Stars,4/4/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I received a sample of this shampoo and conditioner. I wish I could rate how it worked but the scent of gardenia was so strong it made me nauseated. I tried washing it out with my regular shampoo and conditioner but could still smell it. Fragrance is a personal thing and I've never been able to tolerate gardenia but I know others love it, this is just not for me.",1 Star,3/27/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"Finally a Shampoo that works perfectly for my color treated hair! It leaves my hair silky, moisturized without weighing my fine textured hair down. And of course it smells amazing! Rita is a serious LIFE SAVER!",5 Stars,2/2/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I have a lot of hair that frizzes easily, color treated. I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner because they're moisturizing without weighing my hair down and doesn't make my scalp oilier. Hope it's never reformulated ! I don't mind the fragrance but can understand why it could be off-putting.",5 Stars,2/24/17True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I was expecting big things from this shampoo - the description, the price, the packaging. All in all, the strong perfumey scent is the only lingering element - and it's not a good one.",2 Stars,4/11/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,Wow! Not only does it make my hair feel so clean & smooth but also smells amazing! But must use with the conditioner,5 Stars,3/23/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"This shampoo is great, since it leaves my hair clean without stripping the color. I have fine texture highlighted hair, and the color does not oxidize with this shampoo. I have tried many shampoo's, but they strip the color. I also like that, although sulfate free, this shampoo makes suds. Some reviewers found this shampoo drying, but I use it in conjunction with the conditioner, which is great too, and I do not find either drying at all. I recommend!",5 Stars,4/4/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I received a sample of this shampoo (and conditioner) a few months ago. I could not wait to run out of shampoo so I could justify buying this. Be warned: if you want a shampoo that is heavy, this is not that shampoo. Heavy ""nourishing"" shampoos ruin my scalp. Rita Hazan does not. And, while YMMV, I love the ""spicy"" smell. So much better than heavy floral or fruit.",5 Stars,7/13/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,Once I learned Rita Hazan created her own shampoo I HAD to purchase seeing as I've used the Root Concealer for years and low and behold she did NOT disappoint with this one. My hair feels AMAZING after one single use and the scent is BEYOND. Do yourself a favor and buy MULTIPLE.,5 Stars,1/26/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I have thinner, color treated hair, and got this as a sample originally. It made my hair so soft that I had to buy the full size. I'm not one to usually spend this much on shampoo, but it left such an impression on me that I had to buy the full size. I know a lot of people on here are complaining about it drying hair out, but I've had no problem with it, especially after using it with conditioner. It might all depend on hair type though. It does have a strong fragrance, kind of perfume like, but I don't mind it at all.",5 Stars,7/9/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"My hair was a matted clump after rinsing this out, it felt like wet hay, this shampoo was so drying. I loved the tuberose/gardenia fragrance but I'm wondering if that's part of the problem - it's so heavily-fragranced that it makes the formula drying. I would love a more moisturizing version of this.",2 Stars,4/3/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,Smells incredible! But it dries out my hair and strips it of too many of my natural oils. Makes it frizzy,2 Stars,3/31/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"This Poo is no Sham. Skeptical turned believer. It delivers by making my colored, fine but thick hair shine. I plan to get the conditioner",5 Stars,3/14/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,This shampoo and conditioner is not my cup of tea. The scent is WAY too strong which lasts all day long. Worst part about this is it's not even a nice scent.. very masculine smelling. As far as the performance of it... ehh... nothing special.,1 Star,4/18/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"Smell wasn't great, didn't lather and didn't feel particularly moisturizing. :/",1 Star,3/18/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"The smell stings my eyes and leaves my hair very dry. I wanted to love it because I love Rita Hazan root spray, but it isn't a great shampoo.",1 Star,6/5/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,Smells horrible and completely dried out my hair. Will not be purchasing again.,2 Stars,4/4/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"It works, but a shampoo is just a shampoo.",4 Stars,8/18/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I got a sample of this and it did clean my hair. Very gentle, I do not believe it washed out any product build up. The worst part was the very very heavy scent. Felt like I bathed in perfume!",2 Stars,3/20/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I love this shampoo! It really keeps my highlights/lowlights looking freshly done and it smells amazing! It also bubbles up a lot, which I like. Other reviews stated that it's very drying, but maybe I'm the only one who uses conditioner after I shampoo? There's no way I'd be able to brush my hair if I only used shampoo! So, with conditioner after using this, your hair shouldn't be tangled and dry. Will definitely buy again!",5 Stars,3/12/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"My hair has never looked or smelled better in my entire life. This is the best product on the market, and has done wonders for me. Highly recommended.",5 Stars,7/19/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I just used my sample of this and I'm about to order it. Love, love, love! Gorgeous scent, and it left my hair feeling so soft, with no dry or silicone-slick feeling.",5 Stars,3/21/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I have reddish blonde color-treated hair, and this product is gentle enough on the color that it has really stayed true. Smells great too.",5 Stars,4/11/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,This is hands down the best shampoo I have ever used. I have super curly hair but I love to wear it straight and this shampoo makes it easy to manage. It's hydrating but super light weight. It's a must have for any and everyone!,5 Stars,12/16/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"This is the best shampoo iv'e ever used! I love the way it makes my hair look and feel, and it is the best smell ever. I wish I could buy this in a larger bottle",5 Stars,4/12/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,I have read a few reviews about this leaving hair tangled and messy. It does have a strange lather texture. Lathers and dissolves quickly and does feel weird however I believe this is to it not being heavy and weighing hair down with things it doesn't need. Once I use conditioner my hair feels perfect; not to dry or stripped. And the smell is amazing!,4 Stars,12/27/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,I received this as a two pack shampoo. Nice lather and left my hair with a nice smooth texture. What I didn't like was the smell. Has a strong coconut suntan lotion smell which is not a smell I want to have in my hair for all occasions. I was going to the Opera and really didn't want to smell like the beach.,4 Stars,3/14/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I have found the holy grail of conditioner and shampoo for my fine, color treated hair. My hair is soft, shiny and has body. Best of all it doesn't get greasy the next day! The smell is divine.",5 Stars,3/14/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"Personally, I love the smell. It reminds me of Tocca's Florence. I love that it's lasted 24 hours so far. My hair looks great and feels great. How I know I really like a shampoo is how my hair feels immediately after rinsing it out. This felt like it actually did something.",5 Stars,5/6/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,I love how my hair feels and smells after I use the shampoo and conditioner! My color treated hair has never looked better!,5 Stars,12/14/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"LOVE this shampoo and conditioner!! Head and shoulders above Ouai and DryBar -- works incredibly well -- loads of shine, smooth, color protection. smell is unique, does linger a little so make sure you like it. worth every penny, HG for those that want to extend color!!",5 Stars,3/29/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,I literally love the smell of this shampoo. It smells like I get my hair blown out every day. My hair isn't wirey after I use it either but when I wash my hair I always blow dry it to keep its shine. I love this shampoo though,5 Stars,3/18/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,This shampoo smells so good I'd buy it just for the smell. But it works great too. Leaves hair so clean yet silky but not greasy.,5 Stars,3/19/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"Used the sample of shampoo and conditioner today and loved it. Loved the scent, loved how my hair looked and felt. Air dried quickly which wasn't my intention. Obvi the both are pricey but all quality items are.",5 Stars,3/20/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"I received free samples of the shampoo and conditioner and I absolutely loved how my hair felt and looked! I have pretty frizzy hair that tends to get very oily at the roots throughout the day, so I like shampoos that clear up my scalp, but still hydrate enough so I don't poof out once it's dry. I liked the scent and how it lathers, and really need to buy the full sized versions!",5 Stars,7/5/17True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"This shampoo smells delicious and my color didn't fade, but it makes my hair very dry; I can feel it since the moment I rinse it. I do not recommend this product.",2 Stars,4/12/16True Color Shampoo,Sephora,"This line is amazing!!! My hair is soft and manageable, no frizz, no weighed-down locks, nothing but gorgeous! And the smell alone makes me want to buy it! It's not overwhelming and fades just enough in a couple of hours. Leaves me with that hint of fabulous scent and beautiful hair! LOVE!",5 Stars,6/14/17True Color Shampoo,Sephora,I like this shampoo and conditioner. The smell isnt for everyone but I like it! I havent noticed anything terrible with my texture but I also use the hair treatment from RH and it makes my hair soooo soft!,4 Stars,9/14/17
